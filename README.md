This project is a customizable **open-top box** design with multiple trays, created in OpenSCAD.
I made this for my girlfriend so she can have small, organized trays for her lipsticks, powders, and larger makeup items.

The design is **fully parametric**:
- You can adjust the **size of each tray/cell** (length, width, and height).
- You can change the **number of trays** to fit different storage needs.
- You can customize wall thickness, divider thickness, floor thickness, and corner fillet radius.

The script automatically calculates the outer box dimensions based on your tray setup, while ensuring clean, rounded edges with fillets.
Perfect for 3D printing personalized, perfectly sized storage boxes!
